Some quick webtools for online games of Fiasco


I tend to play Fiasco online over Discord with Google Drawings keeping track of details. This allows the facilitator to quickly roll a pool of dice for use in the setup/tilt. I then replace those dice with a count of dice with Black/White, as the values don't matter during scenes. Players take and keep track of their dice pools, and then use the player roller during the tilt/aftermath.

This assumes players are honest and don't re-roll their dice. If they're not you've got bigger problems.

This code is live at [http://ransomti.me/FiascoTools](ransomti.me/FiascoTools).

Barring bugs these are feature-complete quick web tools and I don't plan on adding anything else.
